What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, a '.git' folder is created
which contains data that tracks the history of the files in the repository.
You need to do this in order to have that history recorded.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is where you first make changes. 
The repository is where those changes are stored. 
The staging area is an intermediate space between the two, 
where you can select which files from working directory
you want to include in the next commit.
It allows you to view which changes you are going to commit.
